I know what all is irrelevant. Its okay. It has to be. There is no way
we're gonna get each other so yeah this is useless. It all has to end
someday, I really hope the faster it is, the better.

I'm actually in a hurry to end it. I've lost interest in pursuing it.

Thanks a lot for showing me my place again. This is the last time I came
near and for you. Thanks for showing me how it's done. Thanks for it
all.
