**08:00 AM**

I miss her, a lot. I had texted her yesterday night. She replied.
I replied again today morning and switched off the internet.
Hopefully she'll reply and see that it hasn't been delivered for so long.
I hope she'll see that and text me back. I hope she'll call to check on me.

I hate this feeling. Tears flowing down my eyes all the time.
I've no interest in eating or doing anything.

I hope she's fine. I wish she's fine. May Allah give her all the happiness in this world and fulfil all
her wishes.

I'm just lying on my bed, waiting for my death. I'll never be able to be with anyone ever again probably.
For her I did so many things. I had such a bad patch with my parents also. I was physically hit and what not.

I blame myself for it, not her. It was my mistake. It was all my fault.

They're calling me for breakfast but who'll tell them that I've no hunger, I've no mood to eat,
I've no wish to be alive. I'm better off dead. The faster I go away the better it is.
