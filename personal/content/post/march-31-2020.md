```
I'll not disturb you, never.
I'll not fight with you, never.
Whenever you need me, I'll be there for you. Always.
I don't expect you to even be there around me.
```

It's over I guess. Over for long now. I won't even try hard.

Everyone has a limit. The limit when it exceeds makes things worse.
Ya'll know how bad things can get and they've gotten for me.
I wish I had never done this. I wish a lot of things though,
doesn't matter what I wish. I'll leave one day and never return.
Don't miss me then. I'll be gone for good. I'll be gone for the world.
I'll always be there for you.
