```
He loved,
He loved truly,
and that was his biggest mistake.

Aaron, it's time to leave it all. Be strong. Be patient.

It's time to end it.

I was always stupid. I've held on when I should have clearly
let go. Maybe I should let go of it now, for ever.

How do you even mock someone who life has already mocked enough?

I hope, I wish I hadn't mocked myself so much.

Why did I do so many things for an idiot that doesn't even care?

Why did I end up loving someone who doesn't even value her words?

I hope that there should be days when I can go back to what I was.
