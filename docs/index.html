  <p class="post-summary">He loved,He loved truly,and that was his biggest mistake.Aaron, it&rsquo;s time to leave it all. Be strong. Be patient.
It&rsquo;s time to end it.
I was always stupid. I&rsquo;ve held on when I should have clearly let go. Maybe I should let go of it now, for ever.
How do you even mock someone who life has already mocked enough?
I hope, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t mocked myself so much.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I know what all is irrelevant. Its okay. It has to be. There is no way we&rsquo;re gonna get each other so yeah this is useless. It all has to end someday, I really hope the faster it is, the better.
I&rsquo;m actually in a hurry to end it. I&rsquo;ve lost interest in pursuing it.
Thanks a lot for showing me my place again. This is the last time I came near and for you.</p>

I miss her, a lot. I had texted her yesterday night. She replied. I replied again today morning and switched off the internet. Hopefully she&rsquo;ll reply and see that it hasn&rsquo;t been delivered for so long. I hope she&rsquo;ll see that and text me back. I hope she&rsquo;ll call to check on me.
I hate this feeling. Tears flowing down my eyes all the time. I&rsquo;ve no interest in eating or doing anything.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">It was a realy bad day.
I made a decision that I&rsquo;m surely gonna regret later. I let go of easily. I really really cared, yet I made this stupid decision. Don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.</p>
